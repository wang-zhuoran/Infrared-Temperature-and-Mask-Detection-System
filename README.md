## Description:
Our project aims to create an integrated system combined with mask recognition and infrared thermometer. The system is able to tell the difference whether an individual is wearing a mask or not. Moreover, it can measure an individual's temperature at the same time. The camera and infrared probe will be utilized to implement our project.

## Meeting Logging  
2021.4.11  
Discussed the basic timetable and the hardware platform we need(**Raspberry Pi**). In addition, we decided to use **OpenCV** to recongnize the mask.

2021.4.28  
Installed TensorFlow and MiniConda. Tried simple models implemented in TensorFlow. Machine Learning is still in progress.
