# Infrared-Temperature-and-Mask-Detection-System

## Description:   
Our project aims to create an integrated system combined with mask recognition and infrared thermometer. The system is able to tell the difference whether an individual is wearing a mask or not. Moreover, it can measure an individual's temperature at the same time. The camera and infrared probe will be utilized to implement our project.
